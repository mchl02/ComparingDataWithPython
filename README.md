# ComparingDataWithPython
Using MatPlotLib and Tkinter in python to create scatterplots for the original, reduced, and reconstructed data. Then the different data samples are all compared with the drawn scatterplots. Also before you are able to successfully run the program you will have to change the file_name variables on lines 23-25 with the path of the data samples after you have downloaded them. You can find the path of the data samples by dragging each text to the console or terminal. 
# Pictures
The pictures may be hard to see however, if you download the pictures they will be clear.
